## Problem
Many industries are facing technical obstacles requiring assistance from student with strong educational background.

## Actions
- Implemented a web application which allowed 2000 students to form teams and collaborate on addressing industrial challenges.

## My Tasks

    - Implemented a feature that involved students in participating in a standard questionnaire (NEO), and measured five aspects of their personalities, which helped team members better understand each otherâ€™s work preferences.
    - Conducted the development of a feature that students could select teammates leveraging the results of the standard questionnaire (NEO), leading to a more balanced team.
